# `CLODSS`: *Clo*se<sup>[*](#myfootnote1)</sup> *D*ata-*S*tructures *S*tore #

`clodss` is a data-structures *on-disk* store with an API largly compatible with
`redis`. The goal is to develop a store with the simplicity of the `redis` API
which scales beyond memory capacity, allows harnessing multi-core processors, and
does not burden accesses with network latency.

`clodss` is a product of [Codoma.tech](https://www.codoma.tech/).
